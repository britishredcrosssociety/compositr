\title{Calculate the 'extent' scores when aggregating up small areas}
\usage{
aggregate_extent(data, x, higher_id, lower_pop, weight_high_scores = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A dataframe containing a variable to be aggregated, lower level
geography population estimates, and a higher level geographical grouping
variable.}

\item{x}{Name of the variable in the dataframe containing the variable to be
aggregated (e.g., score) for the lower level geography.}

\item{higher_id}{Name of the variable in the dataframe containing the higher
level geography names/codes.}

\item{lower_pop}{Name of the variable in the dataframe containing the
population estimates of the lower level geography.}

\item{weight_high_scores}{If TRUE higher scores are weighted, else lower
scores are weighted. For indicators like 'Alchol Misuse' and 'Ambulance
Wait Time' this should be set to TRUE. This is because higher values in
these  outcomes indicate worse outcomes (higher vulnerability and lower
capacity) and this is where the weighting should be focused. For indicators
like 'Physical Activity' and 'Bed Availability' it should be set to FALSE.
This is because lower values in these outcomes indicate worse outcomes
(higher vulnerability and lower capacity) and this is where the weighting
should be focused.}

\description{
"Extent" is the proportion of the local population that live in areas
classified as among the most deprived in the higher geography.
}
\section{IMD technical report}{


The calculation of extent is taken from the IMD technical report Appendix N:

"The population living in the most deprived 11 to 30 per cent of Lower-layer
Super Output Areas receive a sliding weight, ranging from 0.95 for those in
the most deprived eleventh percentile, to 0.05 for those in the most deprived
thirtieth percentile. In practice this means that the weight starts from 0.95
in the most deprived eleventh percentile, and then decreases by
(0.95-0.05)/19 for each of the subsequent nineteen percentiles until it
reaches 0.05 for the most deprived thirtieth percentile, and zero for areas
outside the most deprived 30 per cent"

The direction of the scale of data inputted by the functioin always matches
that of the data outputted. For example if data is inputted into the function
where high scores equals high vulnerability, the outputted data set will hold
this relationship true.
